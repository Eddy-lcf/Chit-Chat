# Chit-Chat
Introduction:
ChitChat is a matching and chatting software for university students to meet new friends. Our group cherishes quality chat and matching above all so a token system is developed in our software. Token would be deducted for every matching. The user can use tokens to add filters in the matching so he/she can match with a person he/she wants. As two users are matched, they will be given 15 minutes to chat and have a basic understanding of others. After that, if the user enjoys the chat, he/she may “like” the other user and the software would show his/her contact to the other user. As we encourage appreciation of inner beauty, we do not require and show an image of the user. We hope the software can become a reliable chatting platform for university students and all users may enjoy a quality chat.
